# Two containers are created: one is based on the latest Postgres alpine image;
# the other contains the source code to Rope with libpq preinstalled. The two
# containers are linked with a bridge network and the Postgres container is
# accessible as the postgres host, exposing its DB on the default Postgres port.

# -e: exit when a command fails
# -x: print command as it executes
# -o pipefail: set exit status of shell script to last nonzero exit code, if any were nonzero.
